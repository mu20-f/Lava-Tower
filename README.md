# Lava-Tower


this is first game i build it with game jam lava 

The game is set on a remote island filled with volcanoes and dangers. 
The player finds themselves trapped on the island after an unexpected volcanic eruption.
 But the real surprise lies in the fact that the volcano contains a massive treasure trove of diamonds at its bottom.
 The player feels both excitement and anxiety at the same time, as they must escape the erupting volcano and collect diamonds to survive.
